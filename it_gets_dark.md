High, there's a reason for my high
There's a whole world outside
I saw it last night
Yeah, they're saying I'm insane
'Cause I wanna go to space
And leave it all behind
And leave it all behind
I'm leaving
I (I), I've never, ever been this far away from home
And now I know
It gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
And I, I'm moving at the speed of light, I had to go
But now I know
It gets dark so I can see the stars
Yeah, my feet came off the ground
Gravity won't hold me down
No, not this time
I'm not who I used to be
'Cause I came out here to see
The universe inside
I'm leaving them behind
I'm leaving them
I (I), I've never, ever been this far away from home
And now I know
It gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
And I, I'm moving at the speed of light, I had to go
But now I know
It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
