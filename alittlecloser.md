Spent so many seasons lost inside my mind
Lost inside my mind
Like a message in a bottle
I thought nobody would find
That nobody would find
I've been drifting, I've been dreaming
I would land upon the shore
To a haven, to a harbor
It felt so far before
Well, today, today
What felt so far away feels a little closer
For today, today, today
Feels a little closer
How long these days and darkness
At the bottom of a well?
That old familiar well
Seemed heavy with these secrets
With nobody to tell, nobody to tell
High above the streak of sunlight
And a wall too tall to climb
All the reaching all thе wanting
Just to tumble every timе
But today, today
What felt so far away feels a little closer
For today, today, today
It feels a little closer
And the days carry on
The clouds come rolling in and then they're gone
As the days keep coming on
The midnight sky turns to dawn
Today, today
What felt so far away feels a little closer
For today, today, today
It feels a little closer
A little closer
It feels a little closer
A little closer
It feels a little closer
