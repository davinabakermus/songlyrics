Why should I play this game of pretend?
Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?
Such a great son and wonderful friend
Oh, don't the tears just pour
I could curl up and hide in my room
There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow
I could give in to all of the gloom
But tell me, tell me what for
Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I start to break in pieces?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?
Why should I play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light?
I will sing no requiem tonight
I gave you the world, you threw it away
Leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say
So I can sing no requiem
I hear your voice, I feel you near
Within these words, I finally find you
And now that I know that you are still here
I will sing no requiem tonight
Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I say I'll keep you with me?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?
Why should I play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you and that my world has gone dark without your light? (I can see your light)
I will sing no requiem
Tonight
'Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep
No one lights a candle to remember
No, no one mourns at all
When they lay them down to sleep
So, don't tell me that I didn't have it right
Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white
After all you put me through
Don't say it wasn't true
That you were not the monster
That I knew
'Cause I cannot play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you And that my world has gone dark
I will sing no requiem
I will sing no requiem
I will sing no requiem tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
